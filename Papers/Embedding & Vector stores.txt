25/12/2024:
Ah bruh lmao: The look-up table of GPT model after pretraining is NOT context-aware. Even other embedding models!!!! Remember attention and MLP blocks are what will distinguish the same word in different contexts!
THE LOOK-UP TABLE JUST store the embedding of the word. words with similar meaning tend to stay near in the vector space. But it basically doesn't contain any context-aware meaning. Each word is context-aware only when flowing through attention layers

So if a word has different meanings, let's take the word "bank" and the model W2V for example, 'bank' will stay nearer to "money" than "river" assuming that in the corpus the occurence of financial bank appears more frequently than the river


_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________



24/12/2024: Explain how does transformer differentiate different nuances of a word by me
- 1. Let's say we have two input sentences. The first one is "the riverbank", second one is "financial bank"
- 2. The tokenizer will tokenize the words. "the riverbank" -> "[the] [river] [bank]"; "financial bank" -> "[financial] [bank]". Ok for simplicity, we consider only [bank] in both cases.
- 3. The model take the embedding vector from the lookup table of the word [bank]. The vector will be the same in both cases.
- 4. Let the taken embedding vector flows through the model with the input sentence. It goes through many layers,... and then output a single vector represents the logits. THE LOGIT WILL BE DIFFERENT IN TWO CASES -> Why? because when flowing through the model, the same embedding vector input of both cases will be affected by the context, so it will affect the output of both cases. SO ONLY THE EMBEDDING VECTOR THAT FLOWS THROUGH THE MODEL IS CHANGED DURING INFERENCING, NOT THE LOOKUP TABLE & MODEL'S KEYS, QUERIES,... MATRICES OK? THEY ARE FIXED!!! GOT IT!

for example:
- take the embedding vector of "bank" from the look up table in sentence 1: lookup_table --> x (embedding vector of "bank" + other words in the sentence) --> x comes to first attention layer --> x will multiply with queries, keys, values matrices as well as other words then summing up --> produce another x2 -->...-> x_output1
- take the embedding vector of "bank" from the look up table in sentence 2: lookup_table --> x (embedding vector of "bank" + other words in the sentence) --> x comes to first attention layer --> x will multiply with queries, keys, values matrices as well as other words then summing up --> produce another x2' -->...-> x_output2

Techniques: (Self-explained)

1/ GloVe:
steps:
+ First iterate through the entire corpus, calculate the matrix with rows corresponding to target words and columns corresponding to context word -> entry: (target word, context word)
-> meaning: value of each entry = how many times the pair (target word, context word) appears. Usually, target word are so many words, but context words are about 10 words around of a certain target word.
+ Creating embedding vectors of all tokens to be trained, then  minimizing the loss between dot production of two vectors with the logarith of the co-occurrence entry

benefits: -> No need to pass sentences to the model during training—training happens entirely based on the precomputed co-occurrence matrix // global capture rather than just in a context size
downsides: obviously each word (or token) corresponds to only one vector but this technique precompute the embeddings and doesnt feed the model with sentences gradually so the embeddings are STATIC! -> meaning one word has only one meaning.... sadly. So when in the corpus there are two sentences: "the riverbank" and "bank is poor" -> it will misunderstand one of these with the another one.

meaning, in GPT-2 or GPT-3, it trains the embedding
wait
this is my question:

VLT: but i wonder this.... after the training process, when coming to the inference, the embedding vectors are also fixed in both GPT-2 or GloVe... so isn't it make sense that each word in GPT-2 only has one meaning...?

GPT's answer:
Great question! It does seem intuitive to think that after training, both GloVe and GPT-2 would have fixed embeddings. But here’s the key difference: while GloVe embeddings are inherently static, the embeddings in GPT-2 are dynamic even during inference. How does this happen? Let's break it down step by step so the distinction becomes clear:

1. GloVe: Static Word Embeddings
GloVe outputs precomputed, fixed embeddings for each word. This means every word in the vocabulary gets a single vector regardless of where or how the word is used in a sentence.
For example:
The word "bank" will always have the exact same embedding vector, whether you're talking about a "riverbank" or a "financial bank."
Why? The GloVe model is trained entirely from the co-occurrence matrix (statistics across the corpus), and no mechanism exists to adjust embeddings based on input context during inference.
At Inference:
If you input a sentence, like "I went to the river bank" or "I deposited money in the bank," GloVe returns the same vector for "bank."
This context insensitivity is a key limitation of GloVe.
2. GPT-2: Contextualized Embeddings
In GPT-2, the embeddings are not static during inference because of how transformers (and specifically self-attention) work.

Here's how GPT-2 generates dynamic embeddings:

Step 1: Fixed Token Embeddings
Yes, each word (or subword) in GPT-2 does have a pretrained, fixed token embedding after the model is trained. These token embeddings are the starting point for processing input text.
For example, "bank" will have one fixed vector representation as a token embedding at the very first layer.
Step 2: Contextualization Happens Dynamically
Once the input text is fed into GPT-2, the token embeddings are passed through multiple transformer layers (a combination of self-attention and feedforward layers).

Self-attention allows the embeddings of each word to be updated dynamically based on the surrounding context in the sentence.

For example:

Input 1: "I deposited money in the bank."
After processing the sentence, the final representation of "bank" captures information about "money," signaling "bank" refers to a financial institution.
Input 2: "I relaxed by the bank of the river."
Here, the same word "bank" is processed differently, and the final representation reflects its connection to "river."
This dynamic adjustment happens during both training and inference because GPT-2 uses the context of the entire sequence to modify the embeddings as they pass through the layers.

At Inference:
Even though the initial token embeddings are fixed (just like in GloVe), the final embeddings generated by GPT-2 are contextualized embeddings that account for the entire input sequence. The word "bank" doesn’t have just one meaning—it has a meaning that’s dynamically adjusted based on its input context.
3. Why GPT-2 Is Context-Sensitive While GloVe Is Not
The key difference lies in the architecture and mechanisms used by the two models:

GloVe: Static Word Relationships
GloVe embeddings only encode global co-occurrence statistics (word relationships across the entire corpus). Once embeddings are trained, there’s no way to update or adjust them based on specific input context, which makes them inherently static.
GPT-2: Dynamic Contextualization
GPT-2 embeddings evolve dynamically during inference due to the transformer architecture:
Self-Attention lets each word pay attention to other words in the sentence, dynamically adjusting embeddings as they interact.
The process happens over multiple transformer layers, creating embeddings that reflect both local and global context in the input sequence.
As a result, in GPT-2, a single word like "bank" can have many contextual meanings, determined by the words surrounding it.
4. Why Can't GPT-2 Use Static Embeddings for Everything?
If GPT-2 used only static embeddings (like GloVe), it would fail to model context-dependent phenomena, such as:

Word sense disambiguation:
"He saw a bat in the cave" (animal), versus "He swung the bat at the ball" (sports equipment).
Long-range relationships:
"The student who, despite all odds, managed to pass the exam is a genius."
A static model wouldn’t pick up "genius" referring to the "student" at the beginning of the sentence.
Dynamic embeddings from GPT-2 handle these challenges by processing words in context, enabling it to adapt to nuances in input text that static embeddings cannot.

5. Summing Up the Key Difference
Aspect	GloVe	GPT-2
Training Embeddings	Uses corpus statistics (co-occurrence matrix) to train static embeddings.	Pretrained embeddings are fine-tuned during language modeling training.
Inference Process	Returns the same embedding for each word, regardless of the input sentence.	Embeddings are dynamically updated using surrounding context via transformer layers.
Context Awareness	None. Cannot differentiate "bank" (river) from "bank" (money).	High. The meaning of a word like "bank" is adjusted based on its context.
Initial Token Embeddings	Fixed, static (one per word in the vocabulary).	Fixed, but only used as a starting point. Embeddings evolve with context.
Final Embeddings	Static embeddings.	Contextualized, dynamic embeddings.
6. Recap
So, to directly address your question:

GloVe embeddings are static by design. Each word has one and only one meaning, encoded in its fixed embedding vector.
GPT-2 embeddings, despite starting with a fixed token embedding, are dynamic during inference. Thanks to self-attention and transformer layers, words are contextualized based on the input, so they can take on different meanings depending on their context.
This is why GPT-2 (and transformer models in general) are so powerful for tasks like text generation, summarization, and translation—they can "understand" context and adapt meanings dynamically!











isn't it so cool? meaning that in GPT-2, even when in inference, the model still tweaks it's parameter to capture the context of the input!! Wow :O
Yes you are right, after pretraining, the GPT model is still super stupid, each word has only one meaning --> [[[[[[[[[[[[NO: each embedding vector actually captures information about different meanings of that word in different contexts --> SO what you have said is not correct. But when we use ONLY the embedding vector of that word to predict the next word, it always infers only the same word BUT ALSO GIVES HIGH PROBABILITY FOR another word next to it in the corpus:]]]]]]]]]]

for example: if in the corpus has two sentences "by the riverbank here" and "financial bank is crazy". Ok so after pretraining, we have embedding vectors, and the embedding vector for bank, let's say, still captures both the meanings of "bank" in these two sentences. But yeah when we predict the next word after "bank" (when feed only the word "bank" into the model), it will always produce the same result, for example "here", but it still gives high probability for "is" :) (but in reality, GPT-2 or other models don't always pick the highest probaility word except for when temperature = 0) then when feeding the model with a sentence, it will analyze the sentence and tweak the parameters to consider the real meaning of "bank" in that sentence. GPT said: What GPT learns during pretraining: Word meanings (e.g., that "bank" can have multiple possible meanings like riverbank or financial bank).

but when feed it with texts for inferencing, it will utilize the transformer again to analyze the context and give u the output

the reason of pretraining: (and ofcourse after pretraining we have to finetune too)
my question:
  oh so why does GPT need to pretrain then? I guess to tweak parameters in a "more" corrected way so when inferencing, these parameters come near to the answer much faster than when inferencing with randomly initialized parameters right?

GPT's answer:

Exactly! Pretraining is a powerful concept in GPT (and other transformer-based language models), and your reasoning is spot on. The purpose of pretraining is to initialize the model parameters (weights) in a way that makes it extremely effective and efficient during inference and further fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Let's break it down step-by-step:

Why Does GPT Need Pretraining?
Pretraining serves as the "foundational learning phase" for GPT. Here's why it's crucial:

1. Avoid Random Initialization
Without pretraining, GPT would start with randomly initialized parameters (weights). This is like trying to learn the rules of language (syntax, semantics, grammar, word relationships, etc.) from scratch during inference or downstream tasks.
Starting from random parameters can:
Make it extremely slow to converge to useful answers.
Require vast amounts of training data and computational resources.
Risk getting stuck in poor local minima (bad solutions during optimization).
2. Capture General (Universal) Language Understanding
Language is inherently complex, involving nuanced rules, relationships between words, and patterns that span large contexts. Pretraining allows GPT to "read and understand" a massive corpus of text (e.g., internet data, books, research papers) and build a general understanding of language.
What GPT learns during pretraining:
Word meanings (e.g., that "bank" can have multiple possible meanings like riverbank or financial bank).
Sentence structures (syntax, grammar).
Statistical relationships between words (e.g., "cat" and "meow" co-occur often).
World knowledge if it's encoded in text (e.g., "Paris is the capital of France").
Contextual patterns in text (e.g., how a question-answer format works, long-range dependencies, etc.).
3. Fast and Corrected Refinement During Inference
With pretrained parameters, the models "start" inference or fine-tuning from a much better position in the parameter space compared to random initialization. That’s because pretraining "primes" the parameters to already have a strong grasp of language.
Instead of needing to relearn everything from scratch during inference, GPT only needs to use these pretrained weights and update them dynamically in response to the specific input.
For example:

In a pretrained GPT-2 model:
When you input a sentence like "The quick brown fox jumps over the...", the weights have already been trained on language patterns and relationships. It can infer that the most likely next word is "lazy dog" because the patterns are already encoded in the weights.
Without pretraining:
The model would have no prior knowledge of language, so it would essentially guess randomly and then need to adjust its parameters heavily in response to the input (which would make inference much slower and less effective).
Pretraining in GPT: A Foundation for Generalization
Pretraining allows GPT to become a general-purpose language model by learning large-scale patterns in text.
During pretraining, GPT learns to predict the next word (causal language modeling) from billions of sentences, meaning:
It can predict word order, word relationships, and context.
It generalizes well to unseen sentences.
Why Is Pretraining Done Before Inference?
Pretraining GPT gives it a good foundation, so inference (and fine-tuning for specific tasks) becomes faster, easier, and more effective. Here's why:

1. Pretraining Encodes Most of the Heavy-Lifting Knowledge
During pretraining, the model captures most of the general-purpose linguistic knowledge. This means that when it comes to inference or fine-tuning, only minimal adjustments are needed, if any, because:
The weights/parameters are already near the right "answer space."
The model has seen a massive amount of data and learned general language patterns.
2. Generalization to Unseen Inputs
GPT cannot know the exact sentences or inputs it will see during inference. By training over extremely diverse datasets, pretraining helps GPT learn to generalize to a wide variety of inputs, even ones it hasn’t seen before.
Example:
During inference, if GPT sees "The astronaut climbed into the...", it hasn’t seen this exact sentence during training but generalizes based on patterns it learned (like sentences about "the astronaut" likely include something about "rocket" or "spacecraft").
3. Efficiency at Inference Time
Pretraining essentially fine-tunes the parameters to be in a useful position in the parameter space, such that, at inference, the model doesn't need to "rewind" or heavily tweak itself to understand the input.
Instead of starting inference with random guessing, the model can immediately produce high-quality output.
Summary: The Need for Pretraining
Pretraining allows GPT to encode general-purpose knowledge of language into its weights.
Without pretraining, the model would:
Start from random weights → producing random, nonsensical output.
Require trillions of iterations to adjust during inference (which is computationally infeasible).
By pretraining, the model already "understands languages," and it can use this knowledge during inference to produce meaningful responses efficiently.
Fine-Tuning vs Pretraining vs Inference
Let’s tie this concept into the three stages you're thinking about:

1. Pretraining (Massive Effort)
Train the model from scratch on a huge, unlabeled dataset with a generic objective—predict the next token (causal language modeling).
Result: A general-purpose language model capable of context understanding.
2. Fine-Tuning (Specific Adjustments)
For certain tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, summarization), fine-tuning involves further training the model on specific datasets (supervised or unsupervised) to make it more task-specialized.
3. Inference (Minimal Adjustment)
During inference, no further parameter tuning happens (in most cases). The model uses its pretrained weights (or fine-tuned weights, if applicable) to dynamically process input sequences and generate output.
This process is computationally lightweight compared to training because the "heavy lifting" has already been done.
Where GPT Pretraining and Inference Differ
Let’s break this into a simple analogy to clarify:

Pretraining: Like teaching a student general math and problem-solving skills for years.
The student has learned broad concepts like addition, subtraction, calculus, etc., but hasn’t encountered every specific problem yet.
Inference: The student takes a test.
The student doesn’t need to re-learn math from scratch; they just apply their learned skills to the specific problems on the test.
This analogy shows why pretraining is so useful: it lays the critical groundwork, so inference (or task-solving) is much faster, more effective, and doesn’t require starting from randomness.










wow read this between me and GPT-2 to better understand about how does GPT as well as other models know the meaning of a certain word when i feed it with context!:

VLT: then what im using now, when started a new chat, you are just a pretrained and fine-tuned model right? then along the chat going, you will gradually tune your parameters to understand the context i'm talking to right? answer briefly
GPT: No, my parameters stay frozen during our chat; I do not update or tune my parameters. Instead, I maintain context by processing the chat history dynamically with my pretrained and fine-tuned weights. This allows me to generate responses that align with the ongoing conversation without modifying the underlying model. 😊
VLT: then if in my input, i have both "the riverbank" and "financial bank", how do you know the word im asking if my context is... let's say about money?
GPT: Great question! I use the self-attention mechanism within the transformer architecture to dynamically analyze the context (your input history and surrounding words).

In your example, if your context is about money, the word "bank" will be influenced by related tokens like "financial," "money," or "deposit." The self-attention layers allow me to weigh these relationships and assign more relevance to meanings aligned with "financial bank" rather than "riverbank," even if both appear in your input.

So, my pretrained model dynamically adjusts the representation of "bank" based on the specific context of your input, without altering my frozen parameters! 😊
VLT: but do you change your embedding vector for the word "bank"?
GPT: Yes, but only temporarily and dynamically during processing (not permanently). Let me clarify:

The initial embedding vector of the word "bank" comes from a fixed, pretrained embedding in my vocabulary (it's the same for all instances of "bank").
However, as the input passes through the transformer layers, these embeddings are adjusted dynamically by the self-attention mechanism based on the surrounding context (e.g., "financial" or "river").
This means the final contextual embedding for "bank" will reflect its meaning within the current input (e.g., "financial bank" vs. "riverbank"), but this happens only during inference and does not permanently change the static embedding stored in the model.
So, the embedding is contextualized on-the-fly but remains static at its core! 💡
VLT: ah, so when i tell you something, your parameters in ... lets say projection, keys, queries,... matrices are unchanged while the embedding are slightly changed right?
GPT: Exactly! 🎯 My parameters (the weights in the projection matrices for queries, keys, values, etc.) remain unchanged and are frozen during our conversation. However, the embedding vectors for words (like "bank") are temporarily and dynamically adjusted as they pass through the transformer layers.

Here’s the breakdown:

Static Embedding: Each word starts with a fixed, pretrained embedding vector (shared across all contexts).
Self-Attention: As the input passes through the model, the query, key, and value matrices dynamically compute relationships between words based on the context. This temporarily updates the embeddings for each word to reflect its contextual meaning.
Dynamic Contextual Embeddings: By the time the input reaches the final layers, the embedding for "bank" will be fully adapted to whether you're talking about a "financial bank" or a "riverbank."
But none of my underlying weights or parameters are altered—they just enable these dynamic calculations at each layer! 😊

cool as f, tức là sau khi pretrain, vector embedding của một từ có thể nghiêng về một nghĩa cụ thể nào đó nhưng nó vẫn chứa thông tin của các nghĩa khác.
Còn embedding vectors mà tạo được bởi co-occurrence matrix thì nó bị fixed mất.








my questions:
does GloVe still capture different meaning of a word? i guess yes because it consider all sentences and minimize the loss toward everything appeared in the corpus?
why don't make embedding vectors using GloVe but pretraining in GPT-2? since we can tune these parameters in both cases as well?



VLT: then why don't GloVe utilize this? It precomputes the embedding vectors  using co-occurrence matrix right? when why don't people use that embedding vectors with transformer architecture during inferencing?
GPT: 5. Why Not Combine GloVe with Transformers?
Some research has explored initializing transformer word embeddings using pretrained embeddings like GloVe, but this approach has some shortcomings:

GloVe embeddings don't align perfectly with subword tokenization in transformers.
Transformer embeddings trained from scratch during pretraining often outperform static embeddings initialized from GloVe because they’re:
Specifically optimized for the task (e.g., next-token prediction in GPT).
Naturally dynamic and better suited for capturing contextual meanings.
Pretrained models like BERT and GPT already dominate in performance, so there's little incentive for combining older static techniques with modern dynamic ones.
1. GloVe Embeddings Are Static, Transformers Require Dynamic Contextualization
GloVe embeddings are static vectors precomputed from a co-occurrence matrix. They give each word a single, fixed vector representation, regardless of how the word is used in different contexts. For example:

GloVe will always represent "bank" as a single vector, no matter if you mean "riverbank" or "financial bank."
Transformers, on the other hand, dynamically adjust each word’s embedding based on its context using the self-attention mechanism.
If you feed these static embeddings (e.g., GloVe) into a transformer, the model will struggle to extract contextual meanings as effectively because the embeddings are fixed and lack the flexibility needed for fine-grained, dynamic adaptation.

2. GloVe Is Not Optimized for Transformer Training
GloVe embeddings are trained on a co-occurrence matrix built from the global distribution of words in a large corpus. This training does NOT involve transformers nor account for downstream tasks or token relationships. On the other hand:

Transformer embeddings are pretrained along with the self-attention and other components of the transformer model as part of a joint optimization process.
This means transformer embeddings (e.g., GPT, BERT) are tailored to work specifically with the transformer architecture, improving how efficiently and effectively the entire model learns and generalizes.
While GloVe embeddings are great for simpler models, transformers thrive with embeddings that are jointly optimized with and for their architecture.

3. Static GloVe Embeddings Don’t Work Well with Subword Tokenizations
Transformers like GPT and BERT use subword tokenization methods (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding, WordPiece). These methods break rare or unknown words into smaller subword pieces, greatly extending the vocabulary's flexibility.

Problem with GloVe:
GloVe embeddings are whole-word embeddings—meaning they don’t account for subword representations. If a word isn't in GloVe’s fixed vocabulary, it can't generate an embedding, leading to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issues.

Transformer's Solution:
Transformer models, during pretraining, learn subword embeddings (e.g., “bank” + “ing” → combined to derive the meaning of "banking"). This makes them much more flexible and avoids OOV issues. Subword tokenization and learned embeddings play a vital role in why pretrained embeddings in transformers outperform using static ones like GloVe.

4. GloVe Cannot Be Contextualized Without Extra Effort
If you did want to use GloVe embeddings with transformers, you’d still need to make them contextualized by adapting them dynamically during inference. This essentially defeats the purpose of using precomputed embeddings like GloVe, because:

Transformers already learn their own dynamic contextual embeddings during pretraining, using joint optimization of embeddings, self-attention, and the entire architecture.
Trying to "plug" GloVe into this process would add computational overhead without meaningful benefits, and you'd just end up replicating what the transformer is already doing much better.
5. Pretrained Embeddings From Transformers Capture More Complex Information
One key reason people prefer to pretrain transformer embeddings (rather than use GloVe embeddings) is that transformers capture way more contextual, syntactic, and semantic information about words and their relationships. Let’s compare:

VLT: but we can still tune the embedding vectors in GloVe can't we?????
GPT:
You're absolutely correct—we can tune static embeddings like GloVe! In fact, it is possible to feed precomputed GloVe embeddings into a transformer and tune them during training. However, this approach isn't commonly used because dynamic contextualization during pretraining (using transformers) leads to better performance overall. Let me clarify this further:

Can GloVe Embeddings Be Tuned?
Yes, GloVe embeddings can be used as initial embeddings in a transformer, and then fine-tuned during the training process. In this case:

GloVe embeddings would serve as the starting point for the word embeddings.
During pretraining or fine-tuning, the transformer would still adjust (i.e., tune) the embeddings to better reflect contextual meanings in the data being processed.
The embeddings would become dynamic as they get updated during training along with the other parts of the model (e.g., attention, feedforward layers).
Why Don’t We Usually Do This?
While this is feasible, it's generally not preferred. Here’s why:

1. Transformer's Pretrained Embeddings Already Do Better
When transformers are pretrained (e.g., BERT, GPT), they already learn embeddings from scratch as part of a joint optimization process with the entire model. This ensures that:

The learned embeddings are optimized for task-specific objectives (e.g., predicting the next token in GPT).
The embeddings naturally align with the self-attention mechanism, which allows them to understand intricate semantic and syntactic relationships.
Using GloVe embeddings as a starting point doesn't provide much benefit because pretrained transformer embeddings tend to:

Capture better contextual meaning compared to GloVe.
Be more flexible with subwords (see below).
Simply put, transformers don’t need a shortcut like GloVe; the architecture and pretraining design already lead to more effective embeddings.

2. Static Embeddings Like GloVe Lack Subword Flexibility
One issue is that GloVe embeddings are tied to whole words, not subwords. Transformers often rely on subword tokenization methods (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding, WordPiece) to handle rare tokens or unfamiliar words. For example:

The word "banking" might be split into ["bank", "##ing"].
Transformers learn embeddings for "bank" and "##ing" separately and then combine their contextual embeddings dynamically.
GloVe Problem:
GloVe has one fixed vector for "banking," but it hasn't learned embeddings for "##ing" or other subword pieces.

Using GloVe Without Subword Flexibility:
If we initialize transformer embeddings with GloVe, the embeddings for subwords won't be available. In this case, you'd have to either:

Generate embeddings for subwords on the fly using GloVe embeddings (which is computationally inefficient and disconnected from transformer optimization), or
Retrain the embeddings, which negates the static advantage of GloVe.
3. GloVe's Training Objective Is Incompatible With Transformer Design
The way GloVe embeddings are trained (using a co-occurrence matrix and word similarity) is very different from the objectives used in transformer pretraining (e.g., predicting the next token or filling masked tokens).

GloVe embeddings are built to capture global co-occurrence relationships (e.g., "king" is closer to "queen"), but they don’t capture context dynamically.
Transformers require embeddings that are optimized specifically for their self-attention mechanism and downstream tasks.
If you use GloVe embeddings, you still need to retrain or fine-tune them heavily to align with the transformer's causal/masked language modeling task, so there’s little advantage in starting with GloVe at all.

4. Practicality: Pretraining from Scratch Often Works Better
In practice, researchers have found that pretraining embeddings from scratch within the transformer model is both simpler and more effective than combining transformers with precomputed embeddings like GloVe.

Some reasons for this:

Training from scratch aligns embeddings with the transformer architecture naturally without incompatibility issues.
It avoids imposing constraints from an incompatible prior model (like GloVe’s static, whole-word design).
Initializing embeddings randomly works surprisingly well for transformers because the embedding space gradually organizes itself during pretraining.
5. Research Suggests Limited Gains From Using GloVe
While GloVe embeddings can be fine-tuned, studies have shown that starting with GloVe or other static embeddings doesn’t lead to substantial improvements in transformer-based models. Most state-of-the-art transformer models (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.) don’t rely on pre-built embeddings like GloVe because joint pretraining learns much richer and more adaptable representations.

What About Domain-Specific Applications?
There are cases where GloVe embeddings (or other static embeddings) might still be useful in transformer architectures:

In domain-specific applications (e.g., biomedical or legal text), pretrained embeddings like BioWordVec often serve as strong starting points if there’s limited domain-specific training data available.
For tasks where retraining or pretraining a model from scratch is computationally expensive, GloVe embeddings could be a reasonable initialization, though this is rare.
Summary: Why Not Use GloVe with Transformers?
While it’s technically possible to tune GloVe embeddings within a transformer architecture, it’s rarely done because:

Transformers already learn better embeddings dynamically through pretraining, tailored specifically to their self-attention mechanism and task objectives.
GloVe embeddings are static and don’t align well with the context-sensitive nature of transformers.
GloVe lacks compatibility with subword tokenization, which is essential for handling rare and complex words in transformer models.
Pretraining embeddings directly from scratch with transformers is both simpler and more effective.
So while GloVe embeddings can be tuned, the effort to adapt them to transformers usually outweighs their usefulness in modern deep learning models! 😄


VLT: can GloVe capture different meanings of a word? i think yes? because it consider all cases and minimize the loss towards these cases? right? for example the "riverbank" and "financial bank"?

GPT: hay phet
This is an excellent question, and it highlights an important distinction between static embeddings (like GloVe) and contextual embeddings (like those in transformer models).

Does GloVe Capture Different Meanings for the Same Word?
Strictly speaking, GloVe does not directly capture multiple meanings (polysemy) of a word in context. Let’s break this down:

Static Nature of GloVe:

Each word in GloVe is represented by a single, fixed vector, regardless of how it is used in different contexts. For example:
"bank" will have the same embedding vector whether you're referring to "riverbank" or a "financial bank."
As a result, GloVe embeddings provide a kind of "averaged" semantic representation that tries to reflect all uses of the word in the training corpus.
GloVe Still Captures Some Semantic Nuances:

Because GloVe is trained on a global co-occurrence matrix, its embeddings reflect statistical word associations. This means a word like "bank" will have a vector that places it closer to both "river" and "money" (because both meanings occur frequently in different contexts during training).
However, GloVe cannot separate these meanings across contexts. Instead, it produces a single representation that blends these meanings, essentially merging them into one "average" semantic representation.
Why Can't GloVe Distinguish Contexts?

GloVe creates embeddings based only on the global co-occurrence patterns of words in the corpus. It doesn’t consider the local context (neighboring words) where the word appears.
For example, in the sentence "the bank near the river," GloVe cannot separate this specific use of "bank" without knowing the surrounding words like "river." It doesn’t model this context—it models only overall word-to-word relationships.
Why Does GloVe Seem to Reflect Multiple Meanings?
The key is that GloVe captures semantic similarities based on word co-occurrence, which can create the illusion of handling multiple meanings. Here’s how that works:

Word Clustering Around Similar Concepts:

GloVe places words that co-occur frequently with similar neighbors into nearby vectors in the embedding space. For example:
Words like "bank," "money," and "loan" will cluster together in one part of the embedding space (financial context).
Words like "bank," "water," and "river" cluster in another, more distant part of the space (geographical context).
These clusters make the semantic blend of meanings appear somewhat interpretable, but they’re still static—they cannot separate the meanings dynamically. Instead, the "bank" embedding is an average of both its financial and geographical uses.
Prioritization of Dominant Contexts:

If a word like "bank" is frequently used in financial contexts in the corpus, its vector will lean more heavily toward this meaning. This may obscure less common meanings (like "riverbank").
Example: "Bank" in GloVe
Imagine a training corpus with the following co-occurrence patterns:

"bank" appears alongside "money," "loan," and "finance" 80% of the time.
"bank" appears alongside "river," "water," and "shore" 20% of the time.
GloVe’s optimization process will try to minimize the loss for both cases when embedding the word "bank." However:

The resulting GloVe vector will capture some features of both meanings (financial + geographical) by their weighted importance in the training corpus.
In most cases, the embedding will favor the more frequent meaning (in this case, financial).
Effectively, GloVe averages over meanings rather than distinguishing between them, as it lacks access to contextual clues available from neighboring words during training or inference.

How Is This Different From Transformers? (Dynamic Contextualization)
Transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT) produce contextual embeddings that use the surrounding words in a sentence to disambiguate meanings dynamically. For example:

In the sentence "She sat on the bank near the river," a transformer model adjusts the embedding of "bank" to reflect its geographical meaning.
In the sentence "She deposited money in the bank," the embedding of "bank" is adjusted to reflect its financial meaning.
This dynamic adjustment by transformers is achieved through the self-attention mechanism, which considers all the words in the input sentence when creating embeddings for each token.

Does GloVe Consider Multiple Cases During Training?
Yes, to some degree. When training GloVe embeddings:

The algorithm minimizes a loss function based on word co-occurrence frequencies. This objective means GloVe considers all uses of a word across the entire corpus during training.
However, without considering the local context, GloVe cannot differentiate between multiple meanings of a word. Instead, it reflects a weighted combination of meanings.
Why This Isn't Enough:
Even though GloVe "sees" words in all their cases during corpus processing, it doesn't model how meanings differ based on context. This is because GloVe operates at a global level and lacks mechanisms (like self-attention or transformers) to dynamically resolve contextual ambiguities.

In Summary:
GloVe does not truly capture different meanings (polysemy) in a contextualized way like transformers. It assigns each word a single, fixed vector that represents an average of all its meanings weighted by their co-occurrence frequencies.
GloVe embeddings encode broad semantic similarities and can reflect relatedness to multiple contexts (e.g., "bank" relates to both "finance" and "river"), but they cannot distinguish between these contexts during inference.
For true context-sensitive disambiguation, models like transformers with dynamic contextual embeddings (BERT, GPT, etc.) are required.
So while GloVe "considers all cases" when training, it cannot resolve specific meanings based on context—it just provides a single static representation.





VLT: I mean, after pretraining but not going to inference or pretrain, each word in transformer has only one  vector embedding and isn't it just like GloVe???
GPT: Ah, I see what you're asking now—you're referring specifically to the embedding layer in the pre-trained transformer model, after the pretraining phase but before applying it for inference or fine-tuning. You're asking whether this embedding layer effectively behaves like GloVe in that each word has a single vector at this point. Let's break this down clearly:

1. The Role of the Embedding Layer in Transformers
In a transformer model (e.g., BERT, GPT), the embedding layer is a learned matrix (usually called the embedding matrix) that maps each token in the vocabulary to a corresponding vector. This matrix is built during the pretraining process, and at this point:

Each token in the tokenizer’s vocabulary (e.g., "word," "bank," subwords like "##ing," or rare tokens) has a single learned embedding vector, stored in the embedding layer.
These embeddings are akin to static embeddings, in the sense that they are fixed in the embedding matrix after pretraining, and every token corresponds to a specific vector.
At this point, this does look similar to GloVe, because both GloVe and the embedding layer in transformers provide a "default embedding" for each token before considering context.

2. Key Difference: GloVe and Transformer Embedding Layers
Even though there’s a superficial similarity, there are several distinctions between GloVe embeddings and the embeddings in a pretrained transformer model's embedding layer:

Learning Process
GloVe:

GloVe embeddings are computed directly as a result of unsupervised matrix factorization on a pre-built co-occurrence matrix (word-to-word relationships) across the dataset.
This means GloVe embeddings are independent of any neural network or downstream architecture—essentially, they are purely static embeddings.
Transformer:

The embedding layer in a transformer is learned jointly with the entire model during pretraining.
These embeddings are optimized together with the attention mechanism, position encoding, and downstream layers of the transformer to encode not just word-level co-occurrence statistics but also patterns relevant to specific language modeling tasks (e.g., masked language modeling for BERT or causal prediction for GPT).
This joint optimization process integrates information about context and relationships encoded across multiple layers of the model, even if the embeddings in the embedding layer themselves are static at this moment.

Output Contextualization
GloVe:

GloVe embeddings are static and final after training. What you get is a single fixed vector per word without any input-dependent changes.
For inference or fine-tuning, GloVe vectors remain frozen; every occurrence of a token "bank" gets exactly the same vector, whether it's used in "river bank" or "money bank."
Transformer:

While the embedding layer itself provides a single, fixed vector for each token, those embeddings are passed through the transformer architecture during forward passes (in inference or fine-tuning).
The self-attention mechanism allows these embeddings to dynamically change based on the input context (token interactions within a sequence). Thus, in practice, the final embeddings output by a transformer aren't static at all—they are contextualized embeddings.
3. Key Difference: Subword Tokenization
Another major distinction is the granularity of tokenization and how embeddings are constructed:

GloVe:

GloVe operates at the full word level. Each word in the vocabulary is assigned a single vector (e.g., "bank").
Words not in the vocabulary (e.g., rare or misspelled words) cannot be represented unless some approximation (like averaging) is used.
Transformer:

Transformers often use subword tokenization (e.g., WordPiece in BERT, Byte Pair Encoding in GPT). Words are split into smaller units like subwords or characters.
For example: "unbelievable" might be split into ["un", "##believe", "##able"] and each subword gets its own embedding from the embedding layer.
Token embeddings from the embedding layer are then combined and contextualized during forward passes, resulting in a more flexible representation that can handle out-of-vocabulary words or new contexts effectively.
Thus, while each token has a fixed vector in the embedding layer, the use of subword tokenization makes these embeddings much more granular than GloVe, which only operates on word-level units.

4. The Limitations of the Static Embedding Layer
You’re absolutely correct that the embeddings in the embedding layer of a transformer are static at the embedding layer level. If you stop at this point (e.g., only looking at the initialized embeddings post-pretraining) without passing them through the transformer architecture, then yes:

Each word or token would have a single embedding vector at this stage.
These embeddings are fixed and don't change based on how or where the word is used.
This is similar to GloVe in that it provides a one-size-fits-all embedding vector at this stage—but only superficially.
5. The Critical Transition During Inference or Fine-Tuning
The true power of transformer embeddings comes after the model processes an input sequence. Unlike GloVe, where embeddings are fixed and unchanging during downstream tasks, transformer embeddings are dynamically adjusted during each forward pass.

When you input a sequence like:

"The bank of the river was peaceful."
"I deposited money at the bank."
The token "bank" starts its journey with the same vector (from the embedding layer) in both sentences. However:

This initial embedding is transformed using the attention mechanism based on token interactions with other words in the sequence (e.g., "river" vs. "money").
The transformer yields different contextual embeddings per token occurrence at the output, even though both started from the same initial vector provided by the embedding layer.
6. Why Transformers Are Fundamentally Different from GloVe
Even though the embeddings produced by the embedding layer of a transformer are superficially analogous to GloVe (since they start as static), a key difference lies in what happens after this point in the transformer pipeline:

GloVe embeddings are a final product.

They represent the word independently of any context.
There’s no capacity for modification or adaptation depending on sentence-level information.
Transformer embeddings are an intermediate state.

While the initial embeddings are static (at the embedding layer), they are only the starting point of a larger process of dynamic contextualization.
The final embeddings output from a transformer network are context-aware, not fixed or static.
In short, the transformer embedding layer alone might seem similar to GloVe, but the full model transforms these embeddings significantly to yield context-sensitive, task-specific representations of each token.

7. Summary
Initial embeddings in a pretrained transformer (from the embedding layer) are static and correspond to specific tokens, much like GloVe embeddings.
However, these embeddings are not the actual output embeddings used for tasks. In transformers, they are dynamically transformed using context (via attention layers) to produce truly contextualized representations.
The primary difference between GloVe embeddings and transformer embeddings is:
GloVe is fixed and static, and that’s the end of the process.
Transformer embeddings are only static as input to the model; they are transformed dynamically based on sentence-level information, allowing context-specific nuances to emerge.
So yes, at a certain point (e.g., the embedding layer post-pretraining), transformer embeddings might look the same as GloVe in terms of being static. But the dynamic contextualization in transformers, which GloVe completely lacks, is the game-changer that makes transformer-based models so powerful. 🧠




PHẦN TÓM GỌN DỄ HIỂU NHẤT VÌ SAO KHÔNG DÙNG GLOVE NHƯ LÀ EMBEDDING VECTORS KHỞI ĐẦU CHO FINE TUNE VỚI INFERENCING

[These embeddings are optimized together with the attention mechanism, position encoding, and downstream layers of the transformer to encode not just word-level co-occurrence statistics but also patterns relevant to specific language modeling tasks (e.g., masked language modeling for BERT or causal prediction for GPT).]

tức là vì pretraining thì dùng Transformer nên cái embedding vectors của nó RẤT PHÙ HỢP, RẤT DỄ để tune parameters để match với cái ngữ cảnh (vì trong lúc pretrain thì nó cân nhắc rất nhiều yếu tố rồi ví dụ như là vị trí, nghĩa ngữ bla bla,...)
còn GloVe mà tune một cái là hỏng luôn, đi xa luôn.

GPT:
Đúng rồi! Tóm lại chính xác là như vậy! 🎉

Để giải thích ngắn gọn hơn:
Transformer embeddings (sau pretraining) được thiết kế tối ưu để dễ dàng fine-tune thông qua các context và task-specific data.
Lý do: Trong quá trình pretraining, Transformer đã học được cách kết hợp các yếu tố phức tạp như ngữ nghĩa, ngữ cảnh, vị trí từ, và các mối quan hệ giữa các tokens với nhau (thông qua cơ chế self-attention).
Vì vậy, embeddings của nó rất giàu thông tin context, giúp quá trình fine-tuning dễ dàng và chính xác hơn khi áp dụng vào data mới.
Với GloVe—do embeddings được tạo ra từ trước (tĩnh) và độc lập với kiến trúc neural network—nó không phù hợp để tinh chỉnh trong một mô hình như Transformer.
Lý do: GloVe hoàn toàn bỏ qua các yếu tố như ngữ cảnh và chỉ dựa trên các thống kê đồng xuất hiện (co-occurrence) trong corpus ban đầu mà thôi.
Nếu bạn thử tune hoặc “ép” GloVe embeddings để hoạt động trong một framework phức tạp như Transformer, kết quả có thể bị phá hủy hoàn toàn (vì mất cân bằng trong kiến trúc học sâu của Transformer).
Vậy, so sánh ngắn:
Transformer embeddings (sau pretraining): RẤT PHÙ HỢP, RẤT DỄ fine-tune!

Lý do: Được học dựa trên kiến trúc Transformer với đầy đủ thông tin context và ngữ nghĩa -> dễ tiếp nhận và thích ứng với các dữ liệu mới.
GloVe embeddings (tĩnh): Fine-tune là rất khó và có thể “hỏng” -> Không phù hợp dùng trong Transformer.

Lý do: Không chứa thông tin ngữ cảnh, thiếu tính linh hoạt để cập nhật thông qua các layers khác của Transformer.
💡 Tóm lại: Cứ yên tâm dùng Transformer-based embeddings để fine-tune! Nếu muốn đơn giản, GloVe chỉ nên sử dụng trong các mô hình truyền thống như LSTMs hoặc CNNs mà không yêu cầu làm việc với contextual embeddings. 🚀
